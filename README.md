# Paul Revere Battalion Hackathon 2021-22

Welcome to the 2021-2022 iteration of the PRB Hackathon! Please make sure to read through this years problem set! 

## **Syncing Sensors**

Develop a way for end-users to fuse sensors that are already emplaced in or around a specific geographical area. You can choose a solution that enables sensor fusion for either multiple types of sensors, or sensors of the same kind. 

 Consider the following:
* How might the sensors dynamically trigger one another?
* How might you design a way for the sensors to intelligently trigger one another?
* How might you identify data selectors/multiplexers on the existing emplaced sensors?
* How might you evolve data selectors/multiplexers on the existing systems in a programmatic way?

Consider space, weight, and power (SWAP) for the sensors and the computer/communications required. Backhaul to the big computer (i.e. cloud) is acceptable/expected, but preferred solutions minimize backhaul using algorithms and sensors computer. Do not spend time on connectivity required for backhaul to main computer (i.e. cloud) – *you can assume it is magic.*


## **Autonomous Aviation**

Create an autonomous navigation system for an open source acrobatic drone or smart vehicle that can achieve the following:
* Follow a user-inputted target
* Identify and track targets
* Use waypoints to influence navigation 

Sensors should be incorporated, and no time should be spent figuring out the connectivity for backhaul. 

## **Social Media Security**

Using an open-source social media data set, what can we determine about an individual’s activity and pattern of life based on their online signature? Can we determine an individual’s area of operation, and autonomously identify changes in behavior? 

## **SOCOM Ignite: Wildcard**

Identify an alternate problem that SOCOM faces and solve it. Extra interest will be paid to solutions that integrate with a user's current kit (e.g. TAK or Night Vision)

## **Back to Basics: Jumpable E-Bike**
Develop an electronic mountain bike, which is able to be transported easily, and capable of jumping out of an aircraft. The focus should be on simple and reliable designs that extend the range of human operators without adding extra burden or complexity. Starting off with an existing bike is recommended, but custom designs will also be allowed.
